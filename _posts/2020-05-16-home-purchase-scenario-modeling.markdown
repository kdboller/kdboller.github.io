## Part 1 of Home Purchase Scenario Model Analyses.

### Introduction.

This post is the third installment in my series on leveraging ``Python`` for finance, specifically stock portfolio analyses.  In <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/python-for-finance-stock-portfolio-analyses-6da4c3e61054" target="_blank">part 1</a>, I reviewed a Jupyter notebook with all of the code needed to extract financial time series data from the Yahoo Finance API and create a rich dataframe for analyzing portfolio performance across individual tickers.  The code also included a review of some key portfolio metrics with several visualizations created using the ``Plotly`` library.  In <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/python-for-finance-dash-by-plotly-ccf84045b8be" target="_blank">part 2</a>, I extended Part 1's analyses and visualizations by providing the code needed to take the data sets generated and visualize them in a ``Dash by Plotly`` (``Dash``) web app.

**Disclosure:** Nothing in this post should be considered investment advice. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future returns. I am writing about generalized examples and show how to evaluate home purchase scenarios and the relative opportunity cost to allocating some/all of this capital to other investment opportunities. You should direct all investment related questions that you have to your financial advisor and perform your own due diligence on any investments mentioned in this post.  Therefore, I assume no liability for any losses that may be sustained by the use of the method described in this post, and any such liability is hereby expressly disclaimed.
