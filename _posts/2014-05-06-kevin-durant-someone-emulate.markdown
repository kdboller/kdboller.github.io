Major sporting events, such as the Super Bowl, NCAA March Madness tournament, and the Masters were a huge part of my life 
while I was growing up in Atlanta – and they certainly continue to be so today.  In some respects, these events were similar to holidays in that the entire family would oftentimes get together, with additional friends and relatives, to cheer for their favorite athletes and hope that their respective teams would end up as champions.</p>

<p>My favorite sporting events also involved the sports in which I was an active amateur player – for this reason, March Madness to me was the absolute best time of the year, and I also grew up during the years that Michael Jordan was on top of the basketball world.  I emulated my favorite teams and was captivated by Jordan’s amazing talent and sheer determination to win. I’ll never forget the first pair of Jordan’s shoes that my mom, while in somewhat disbelief at the cost, allowed me to have. I think I’d recently done well in school or been on my best behavior in recent weeks, but either way it was a childhood memory that I will have forever – it was an incredible feeling to put on the same shoes as those worn by my basketball idol.</p>

<p>This brings me to present day and the incredible impression that Kevin Durant continues to leave on me, most basketball 
enthusiasts and really the general public. As most know, Durant was named the NBA’s MVP last week and he gave one of the most 
impressive and heart-felt acceptance speeches that I can recall. What struck me and others about his speech was how he singled 
out all of his teammates, sometimes in a humorous way, but always clearly conveying what each one meant to him and his growth 
as a player and as a person. Kevin Durant truly gets how to be a great team player. He also understands the fact that it is 
those around him who contribute to his success and allow him to pursue his most challenging goals.

<p>As sports fans, we often tune in live to see how the drama will unfold, if there will be a last second shot, and who will win the title. While I love sports for these reasons as much as the next person, it’s the moments like KD’s acceptance speech 
which take me back to my days as an amateur athlete and all the great times I shared with my parents and brothers. 
While I could not be with my mother this past Mother’s Day, KD’s final tribute to his mom made me want to hug my mom and 
thank her for all of her sacrifices which she made for me while I was growing up:</p>

<strong>“…When you didn’t eat, you made sure we ate. You went to sleep hungry. You sacrificed for us. You’re the real MVP.” </strong>
-- Kevin Durant about his MVP Mom

<p>Sports allow us to witness incredible feats by the best athletes in the world. However, for me, what’s even better are all 
of the childhood memories from my days of playing sports while my dad often coached and my mom cheered. 
Sports will always play an important role in my life, as the memories last forever and because exceptional people like Kevin Durant should be emulated, both on and off the court.
