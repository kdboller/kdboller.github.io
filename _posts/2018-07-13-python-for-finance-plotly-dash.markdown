## Part 2 of Leveraging Python for Stock Portfolio Analyses.

**As of 7/13, this post is currently in process.  Look forward to sharing a follow-up to the Python in Finance post with a dashboard, which includes some interactivity, using Plotly's Dash.**

In [part 1](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-for-finance-stock-portfolio-analyses-6da4c3e61054) of this series I discussed how, since I've become more accustomed to using ``pandas``, that I have signficantly increased my use of ``Python`` for financial analyses.   During the part 1 post, we reviewed how to largely automate the tracking and benchmarking of a stock portfolio's performance leveraging ``pandas`` and the ``Yahoo Finance API``.  At the end of that post you had generated a rich dataset, enabling calculations such as the relative percentage and dollar value returns for portfolio positions versus equally-sized S&P 500 positions during the same holding periods.  You could also determine how much each position contributed to your overall portfolio return and, perhaps most importantly, if you would have been better off investing in an S&P 500 ETF or index fund.  Finally, you used ``Plotly`` for visualizations, which made it much easier to understand which positions drove the most value, what their YTD momentum looked like relative to the S&P 500, and if any had traded down and you might want to consider divesting, aka hit a "Trailing Stop".

I learned a lot as part of building this initial process in Jupyter notebook, and I also found it very helpful to write a post which walked through the notebook, explained the code and related my thinking behind each of the visualizations.  This follow-up post will be much shorter than the prior one and more direct in its purpose.  While I've continued to find the notebook that I created helpul to track my stock portfolio, it had always been my intention to learn and incorporate a ``Python`` framework for building analytical dashboards / web applications.  One of the most important use cases for me is having the ability to select specific positions and the desired timeframe, and evaluate the relative performances of each position.  In the future, I will most likely expand this evaluation case to positions I do not own but am considering acquiring.  For the rest of this year, I'm looking to further develop my understanding of building web applications in ``Flash``, ``Heroku`` deployment, and ideally develop some type of a data pipeline to automate the extracting and loading of new data for the end web application.  While I'm still rather early on in this process, in this post I will discuss the extension of the notebook I discussed last time with my initial development using ``Plotly Dash``.
