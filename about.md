<p> My professional experience spans software consulting, investment banking, consumer-facing product management and data warehouse ownership, as well as product and data analytics leadership. </p>

<p>
  Most recently I served as VP Product (Revenue and Analytics) at FloSports in Austin, TX; I spearheaded subscription revenue generation, the data warehouse development and our data and analytics roadmaps; during my tenure, we started from scratch and built a data warehouse with 15+ daily refreshed data sources and grew to ~150 company users on our business intelligence dashboards. I selected Periscope Data, Mode Analytics and Segment (customer data platform and unlimited sources), while also conducting extensive price testing which led to a significant modification in our pricing strategy. 
</p>

<p>Prior to this, I was a Vice President in Blackstone's Advisory Partners (M&A) group. From 2011-2012, I was a member of the deal team which advised the Los Angeles Dodgersâ€™ former owner and management on the $2.3 billion sale of the team, stadium, media rights and real estate to Magic Johnson and Guggenheim Partners.</p>

<p>
After graduating from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, I worked at Rothschild and was a member of the deal team who sold a minority stake in Creative Artists Agency to TPG Capital. 
</p>

<p>Before business school, I was a healthcare IT consultant, leveraging SQL and implementing software in a client-facing role. </p>
