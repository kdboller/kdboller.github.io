<p> My professional experience spans software consulting, investment banking, product management (consumer and enterprise), data warehouse product ownership, and data analytics leadership. </p>

  I am a PM in Amazon’s Kindle Content group. I work with the Enterprise Publisher Experience (EPX) dev team, driving new features which support growth in our Publisher Experience (PX) offering. Prior to this, I served as VP Product (Revenue and Analytics) at FloSports in Austin, TX. 
When I started at FloSports, the company had no data warehouse and no business intelligence dashboarding. I selected Amazon Redshift and Periscope Data, and during my tenure we developed a data warehouse with 15+ daily refreshed data sources while empowering 100 company users with BI dashboards. 

<p>Prior to this, I was a Vice President in Blackstone's Advisory Partners (M&A) group. From 2011-2012, I was a member of the deal team which advised the Los Angeles Dodgers’ former owner and management on the $2.3 billion sale of the team, stadium, media rights and real estate to Magic Johnson and Guggenheim Partners.</p>

<p>
After graduating from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, I worked at Rothschild and was a member of the deal team who sold a minority stake in Creative Artists Agency to TPG Capital.
