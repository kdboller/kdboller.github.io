<p>I am a PM on Amazon’s single threaded Publisher Analytics team. I work with a dedicated reporting and analytics dev team, driving new reporting and analytics features to support growth in our Publisher Experience (PX) offering. I previously served as VP Product (Revenue and Analytics) at FloSports in Austin, TX, where I selected Amazon Redshift and Periscope Data for our warehouse and BI reporting. During my tenure we developed a data warehouse with 15+ daily refreshed data sources while empowering 100 company users with BI dashboards. </p>

From 2011-2012, I was a member of the deal team which advised the Los Angeles Dodgers’ former owner and management on the $2.3 billion sale of the team, stadium, media rights and real estate to Magic Johnson and Guggenheim Partners.</p>

<p>After graduating from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, I worked at Rothschild and was a member of the deal team who sold a minority stake in Creative Artists Agency to TPG Capital. </p>
