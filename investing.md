I'm ramping up my activity in the PNW as an active angel investor and advisor to early-stage companies.

In the spirit of being a founder-friendly investor and advisor, below are a few very helpful founder resources:
* **[Grubstakes](http://grubstakes.vc)** -- 20+ individual investors in Seattle that fund and mentor startups in the Pacific Northwest.
* **[Seattle Angel](http://www.seattleangel.com)** -- Seattle Angel is a not for profit organization, focused on educating angel investors, entrepreneurs, and prospective team members about the ins and outs of raising startup capital, scaling business operations, and related legal and financial issues.
* **[UW Comotion](https://comotion.uw.edu)** -- CoMotion® is UW’s collaborative innovation hub dedicated to expanding the economic and societal impact of the UW community and beyond.
* **[WeWork Labs](https://www.wework.com/labs)** -- global community of early-stage startups with membership benefits including workspace, mentorship and education.

I've lived in Seattle for a few years after being born in Portland, OR, growing up in Atlanta and living a bit all over -- Dallas, Chicago, NYC, and Austin.
My background includes co-founding a sports tech start-up (LeagueCast, 2013 - 2015), serving as VP of Product at a direct-to-consumer live sports company (FloSports, 2016 - 2017) and now as a product manager of a greenfield reporting and analytics solution at Amazon (2017 - present). 

In the start-up realm, my experience includes working for companies at the sweat equity, bootstrapping, friends and family and Series B and C stages, and also self-funded LeagueCast, a start-up that I co-founded.
