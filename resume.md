As mentioned on my home page, I am rather passionate about the analytical revolution unfolding across sports media and sports technology and I am interested in consulting, advisory and board member work within the sports technology space.

On this page you'll find my generally up-to-date, traditionally formatted resume.  
Please feel free to download my resume [here](/assets/Boller_Kevin_Resume_2017.pdf) directly.

My resume has also been included below in markdown format.
